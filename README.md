Message From Original Auther:

I can't read or write any Japanese nor Korean. All JN/KR names are copied from Wiki pages. If you find any mistake, feel free to correct it. 

Operator IDs are Profile IDs in game. They can also be used to search for operators on CN wiki. EN/JN/KR wiki don't have these IDs on their main page.
Enemy IDs can be used to search for enemies on EN/JN wiki. CN/KR wiki don't have these IDs on their main page. All the blanks are missing infomation either wiki pages don't have or characters havn't been uploaded on different servers by Hypergryph yet.

Here are all the Arknights wiki websites I have used
CN: https://prts.wiki/w/
EN: https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Arknights
JN: https://arknights.wikiru.jp/
KR: https://thewiki.kr/w/

IC means integrate codename of Hypergryph art data. That's the reason why I create this file to locate Hypergryph art data and use it in fan game development.

It's unlikely for me to update this file in future Arknight updates. So feel free to update and republish this file on any website. The only thing I'm asking for is please preserve this message and add your signature. However, commerical use of this file is NOT allowed!!!
